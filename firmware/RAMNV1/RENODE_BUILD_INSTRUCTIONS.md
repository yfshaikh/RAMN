# RAMN FreeRTOS ARM_CM3 Port Setup for Renode

## Summary of Changes Made

We've set up conditional FreeRTOS port usage to avoid ARMv8-M register incompatibilities in Renode:

### ‚úÖ Changes Completed:

1. **Added ARM_CM3 Port Files:**
   - `Middlewares/Third_Party/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/portmacro.h`
   - `Middlewares/Third_Party/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM3/port.c`

2. **Updated STM32CubeIDE Project:**
   - Added ARM_CM3 include path to Debug and Release configurations
   - `RENODE_SIM` is already defined as a preprocessor symbol

3. **Re-enabled FreeRTOS in main.c:**
   - FreeRTOS scheduler now starts when `RENODE_SIM` is defined
   - Removed the UART test loop that was bypassing FreeRTOS

4. **FreeRTOS Configuration:**
   - `FreeRTOSConfig.h` already has proper RENODE_SIM guards
   - FPU, MPU, and TrustZone disabled for Renode builds

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Build the Project
1. Open STM32CubeIDE
2. Clean and rebuild the project (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+X)
3. Ensure `RENODE_SIM` is defined in preprocessor symbols (already configured)
4. Build should complete successfully

### Step 2: Test in Renode
1. Load the new ELF file in Renode:
   ```
   (monitor) i @/path/to/ramn_mac.resc
   ```

2. Start execution and check for output:
   ```
   (monitor) start
   ```

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - You should see: `"RENODE_SIM: UART working! Starting FreeRTOS scheduler with ARM_CM3 port..."`
   - FreeRTOS should start without the previous register write errors
   - UART output should continue working
   - Tasks should run normally

## üîß What This Fixes

**Before:**
- FreeRTOS CM33 port wrote ARMv8-M system registers (PSPLIM/MSPLIM)
- Renode reported: "write access to unsupported AArch32 64 bit system register"
- Scheduler never started, no RTOS functionality

**After:**
- ARM_CM3 port avoids ARMv8-M specific registers
- Compatible with Renode's Cortex-M33 emulation
- Full FreeRTOS functionality available
- All RAMN tasks and features can run

## üìã Next Steps After Testing

If FreeRTOS starts successfully:

1. **Re-enable CAN Bus:**
   ```c
   // Remove RENODE_SIM guard from main.c
   MX_FDCAN1_Init();
   ```

2. **Test ECU Features:**
   - Diagnostic protocols (UDS, KWP2000)
   - CAN message handling
   - Multi-ECU communication

3. **Full ECU Simulation:**
   - Test automotive protocols via UART and CAN
   - Simulate real ECU scenarios

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**If build fails:**
- Check that both ARM_CM3 and ARM_CM33_NTZ paths are in include directories
- Verify `RENODE_SIM` is defined in preprocessor symbols

**If FreeRTOS still doesn't start:**
- Check console output for any remaining register access errors
- Verify the ARM_CM3 port files were created correctly

**If UART stops working:**
- The UART configuration should remain the same
- Check that LPUART1/USART1 mapping in `main.c` is still correct

This setup gives you the best of both worlds: full RTOS functionality in Renode while maintaining hardware compatibility for real ECU deployment! üéâ
